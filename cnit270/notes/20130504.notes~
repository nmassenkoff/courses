 	<h1 id="heading">Apache</h1>
	<h2 id="heading">Installation</h2>

	only focus on linux

	download software (binary or source)

	prefer source so that you can tweak it.

	Option list very long (hundreds)

	set c compiler (cc=/usr/sbin/gcc)

	get at httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

	usually come as tarball (http-NN.tar.gz where NN=version number)

	<pre>
		tar -zxcf httpd-NN.tar.gz

		cd httpd-NN
		./configure --prefix=xxx (where xxx = any sub directory to install apache i.e. /usr/local/apache, the default is /usr/local)
	</pre>

	./configure ouputs makefile

	<pre>
		make (has options install, test, and clean)
		make test
		(become root)
		make install
		make clean (remove byproducts that are no longer important, often very large)
	</pre>
	<h2 id="heading">Testing Installation</h2>

		<h3 id="heading">First Modify Config File</h3>

	<pre>
		vim xxx/conf/httpd.conf 
		(Do so modifications, detail later)

	</pre>
		start apache, 3 possible ways:
	<pre>
		xxx/bin/apachectl -k start
	or
		cd /etc/init.d
		httpd start
	or
		service httpd start
	</pre>
		After start very silent (hard to know if everything is working)

		Inspect log files to verify httpd is running correct

		something about apache portable run time

		xxx/srclib/apr
		xxx/srclib/apr-util

		./configure --with-included-apr
		./configure --with-included-apr-util

		Apache requires perl (or PCRE library [PCRE-xxx.tar.gz]

	<h2 id="heading">Upgrading Apache</h2>

		when unpacking apache two configure files exist:
			./configure
			./configure.nice

		./configure.nice is used for upgrade
		./configure.nice downloads latest version
		use --prefix=xxx to make sure not to have two separate installs

	<pre>
		./configure.nice --prefix=xxx
		make
		make test
		make install
		make clean
	</pre>

		after upgrade must bring down old httpd, and start new one

	<pre>
		xxx/bin/apachectl -k gracefull stop
		xxx/bin/apachectl start

	<h4 id="heading">using yum</h4>
	yum install httpd

	<h4 id="heading">Logfiles</h4>

	located: xxx/logs/

	xxx/logs/http.pid ("group" process id or parent pid for all httpds

	used for "rainy days" ie you need to shutdown httpd server and the only way you can do it is by pid.

	kill -9 $(cat xxx/logs/http.pid)

	also can kill by using config file directive:
	PidFile /usr/sbin/httpd.pid

	if kill must remove xxx/logs/http.pid or else cannot restart httpd (httpd.pid file acts as lockfile)
